The algorithm for 4 points:	(Algorithim for BEZIER'S CURVE)

Connect control points by segments: 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 4. There will be 3 brown segments.
For each t in the interval from 0 to 1:
We take points on these segments on the distance proportional to t from the beginning. These points are connected, so that we have two green segments.
On these segments we take points proportional to t. We get one blue segment.
On the blue segment we take a point proportional to t. On the example above it’s red.
These points together form the curve.
