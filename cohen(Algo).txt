Cohen-sutherland Algorithim:\


Step 1 : Assign a region code for two endpoints of given line.\
Step 2 : If both endpoints have a region code 0000 \
         then given line is completely inside.\
Step 3 : Else, perform the logical AND operation for both region codes.\
    Step 3.1 : If the result is not 0000, then given line is completely\
               outside.\
    Step 3.2 : Else line is partially inside.\
        Step 3.2.1 : Choose an endpoint of the line \
                     that is outside the given rectangle.\
        Step 3.2.2 : Find the intersection point of the \
                     rectangular boundary (based on region code).\
        Step 3.2.3 : Replace endpoint with the intersection point \
                     and update the region code.\
        Step 3.2.4 : Repeat step 2 until we find a clipped line either \
                     trivially accepted or trivially rejected.\
Step 4 : Repeat step 1 for other lines\
